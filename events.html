      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        The start-up Augmented Reality (AR) design agency based in Lawrence, KS is hosting the public art show as a part of local art walk Final Friday event! Using Snapchat app installed on iPhone/Android phone, the visitors will scan the code for the digital art works, and can view them by projecting onto the wall or on a pedestal if it's a 3D model through the screen.
      </p>
      <h2>Location</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
          The event takes place at Signs Of Life Art Gallery located in downtown Lawrence, KS. The store consists of 1st floor as a bookstore and coffee shop and the 2nd floor as a spacious art gallery. The wooden floor and the old-building style architecture provides a traditional art gallery flavor. The scene fits the idea of illusion between the physical reality and the augmented reality we attempt to create. 
      </p>

      <h2>When</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
          The display is available for views for two days, the evening of Friday 27th and all-day Saturday 28th while the store is open (close at 9pm). The opening event starts around 6pm on Friday with cookies and coffee/teas. 
      </p>

      <h2>Call for Submission</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
          This is a public art show where everyone can visit and also everyone can submit their art work. For 2D art pieces, we will make a snapchat lens for each of your digital art works (graphic design, photography, scanned image) which is essentially a 3D augmented reality object of framed image. The artists can submit the digital file to us with the $10 fee through paypal. 
          Images are in jpeg or png and should never be greater than 2048 x 2048 pixels. </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
          For 3D object or models, please follow the export guide on  <a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/guides/3d/3d-object-export/">Lens Studio help site</a>. It explains how to export the model from Maya, Blender, Cinema 4D and 3DS Max. We recommend to export in fbx which is our preferred format. Please note that the texture files may need to be sent separately. As far as we are aware, Len Studio seems to accept the texture only by importing the texture files separately. That means you would want to zip two files fbx and texture files in textures folder. 
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            By submitting, the intellctual property of the art form is obviously still maintained by the artists, and we believe we are allowed to publish the snapchat lens from our account and use the image for our promotion purpose and so on. We are just trying to state the common sense here. 
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph">
          For any of the submissions, please make sure to have in the email subject “ARt show art submission”,
