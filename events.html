      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        The start-up Augmented Reality (AR) design agency based in Lawrence, KS is hosting the public art show as a local art walk Final Friday event! Using Snapchat app installable on iPhone/Android, the visitors will scan the code for the digital art works, and can view them through projecting onto the wall or on a pedestal if it's a 3D model.
      </p>
      <h2>Location</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
          The event takes place at Signs Of Life Art Gallery located in downtown Lawrence, KS. The store consists of 1st floor as a bookstore and coffee shop and the 2nd floor as a spacious art gallery. The wooden floor and the old-building style architecture provides a traditional art gallery flavor. The scene fits the idea of illusion between the physical reality and the augmented reality we attempt to create. 
      </p>

      <h2>When</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
          The display is available for views for two days, the evening of Friday 27th and all-day Saturday 28th while the store is open (close at 9pm). The opening event starts around 6pm on Friday with cookies and coffee/teas. 
      </p>

      <h2>Call for Submission</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
          This is a public art show where everyone can visit and also everyone can submit their art work. For 2D art pieces, we will make a snapchat lens for your digital art work (graphic design, photography, scanned image) which is essentially 3D augmented reality object of framed image. The artists (or anyone) can submit the digital file to us with the $10 fee through paypal. 
          Images should never be greater than 2048 x 2048 pixels in jpeg or png. </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
          For 3D object or model, please follow the export guide on  <a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/guides/3d/3d-object-export/">Lens Studio help site</a>. It explains how to export the model from Maya, Blender, Cinema 4D and 3DS Max. Please note that the texture files may need to be sent separately. As far as we are aware, Len Studio seems to accept the texture only by importing the texture files separately. 
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
          For any of the submissions, please make sure to have in the email subject “AR show art submission”,
          And include the following in order:
          <p class="paragraph">
          Title: the title of your art work <br>
          By: the name of the artist it could be a real name or snapchat username or whatever
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
          Make sure to use the same email address when used to send us $10 submission fee.
          Please submit images that are acceptable to display in the public so that we can accept many submission from as many artists as possible without spending time on curating or even sorting the inappropriate images out of the display.
